go httpsで、pkcs12ファイルを使う。

goにpkcs12を扱う機能が付いたのは、[crypto/x509: reading certificates from PKCS12 files #10621](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10621) のPRから。

> It would really be best for the world if all the PKCS standards disappeared so there is a long-term cost to making it easier to use them. However, that doesn't remove the need that some people have to deal with them today.

やれやれって言う感じのことが書いてあった。
